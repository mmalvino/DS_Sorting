# Bubbling Through Data Structures: LinkedList vs. Array!🫧🫧🐙

## Description
This Sorting Application is a Java-based program that allows users to sort a sequence of numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. It provides two different implementations: one using an array data structure and the other using a linked list data structure. The application offers flexibility in input options, including reading numbers from a text file or entering them manually.

## Installation
* Ensure that Java is installed on your system.
* Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
* Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

## Usage
1. Run the program by executing the main class BubbleSortArray or BubbleSortLinkedList.
2. Choose the input option by entering 'F' for reading from a file or 'M' for manual input.
3. If you select 'F', ensure that the test.txt file is present in the project's resources folder. Modify the file or add new test cases as desired.
4. If you select 'M', enter the numbers separated by commas when prompted.
5. The program will display the original list of numbers.
6. It will then execute the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the numbers.
6. The sorted list will be displayed, along with the time taken for the sorting process.


We have 15 test cases (.txt files) along with the Number of Integers in a Set and also the Range of Integers:

>please note that it will take longer to run as you go further down with the test cases

```
test1 = 10 (range: -1000 to 1000)
test2 = 50 (range: -5000 to 5000)
test3 = 100 (range: -10000 to 10000)
test4 = 250 (range: -25000 to 25000)
test5 = 500 (range: -50000 to 50000)
test6 = 750 (range: -75000 to 75000)
test7 = 1000 (range: -100000 to 100000)
test8 = 1500 (range: -150000 to 150000)
test9 = 2000 (range: -200000 to 200000)
test10 = 2500 (range: -250000 to 250000)
test11 = 3000 (range: -300000 to 300000)
test12 = 3500 (range: -350000 to 350000)
test13 = 4000 (range: -400000 to 400000)
test14 = 4500 (range: -450000 to 450000)
test15 = 5000 (range: -500000 to 500000)
```
